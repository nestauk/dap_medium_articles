This folder contains the code behind the [medium article]() with the example streamlit app.

To see the live app, click this [link](https://dap-tutorial-geographical-iod-deciles.streamlit.app/), the password is `Nesta@IoD`.

If you wish to run the app locally, follow the instructions below.

## Set up üõ†Ô∏è

`conda activate streamlit_app_tutorial`

5. **Install package dependencies:**

If pip is not installed, install pip by `conda install pip`.

6. **Open the `streamlit_demo_iod_analysis.py` file and have a read through!** 

7. **Run the app on your local machine:**
