This repo contains code behind articles published on [Medium's Data Analytics at Nesta](https://medium.com/data-analytics-at-nesta). We're going to be adding directories with code whose original purpose is to serve a medium blog. Each directory will refer to a medium article and will contain everything you'll need to replicate the code behind the article. These will not contain live updating notebooks, but instead are helpful, stand alone tutorials about the tips and tricks we've learned doing data science for social good. 

If you're interested in code behind our _projects_, do check out [our wide range of public repos](https://github.com/nestauk) for projects like [Innovation Sweet Spots](https://github.com/nestauk/innovation_sweet_spots) and our [Skills Taxonomy](https://github.com/nestauk/skills-taxonomy-v2).
